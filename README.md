# How to run the files
If you are interested in training the model and playing around the hyperparameters to achieve better results, use the PyTorch_Chatbot file.

For testing the file and chatting with the bot, run directly ChatWithChatbot file. Load one of the .tar files, which were created with different Luong Attention methods. Make sure below Configure models comment, the same attention model and the same respective .tar files are loaded.

For better results, load the files in Google Drive, since they are directly linked with the file.
